# AWP Alliance Auton

A very basic VEXCode project for alliances that do not have autons. It moves
their bot off the starting line making the Alliance eligible for the AWP.

### Usage

> Pay attention to motor reversings.

1. Update motor ports
2. Make sure desired drive mode is enabled
3. Upload (preferably to Slot 1 to reduce risk of running the wrong program)
